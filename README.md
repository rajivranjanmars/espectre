## 📖 How It Works (Simple Version)

When someone moves in a room, they "disturb" the Wi-Fi waves traveling between the router and the sensor. It's like when you move your hand in front of a flashlight and see the shadow change.

The ESP32-S3 device "listens" to these changes and understands if there's movement.

### Advantages

- ✅ **No cameras** (total privacy)
- ✅ **No wearables needed** (no bracelets or sensors to wear)
- ✅ **Works through walls** (Wi-Fi passes through walls)
- ✅ **Very cheap** (~€10 total)

### What is CSI (Channel State Information)?

**Channel State Information (CSI)** represents the physical characteristics of the wireless communication channel between transmitter and receiver. Unlike simple RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator), CSI provides rich, multi-dimensional data about the radio channel.

#### What CSI Captures

**Per-subcarrier information:**
- **Amplitude**: Signal strength for each OFDM subcarrier (up to 64)
- **Phase**: Phase shift of each subcarrier
- **Frequency response**: How the channel affects different frequencies

**Environmental effects:**
- **Multipath propagation**: Reflections from walls, furniture, objects
- **Doppler shifts**: Changes caused by movement
- **Temporal variations**: How the channel evolves over time
- **Spatial patterns**: Signal distribution across antennas/subcarriers

#### Why It Works for Movement Detection

When a person moves in an environment, they:
- Alter multipath reflections (new signal paths)
- Change signal amplitude and phase
- Create temporal variations in CSI patterns
- Modify the electromagnetic field structure

These changes are detectable even through walls, enabling **privacy-preserving presence detection** without cameras, microphones, or wearable devices.

## 💡 What You Can Do With It

### Practical Examples

- 🏠 **Home security**: Get an alert if someone enters while you're away
- 👴 **Elderly care**: Monitor activity to detect falls or prolonged inactivity
- 💡 **Smart automation**: Turn on lights/heating only when someone is present
- ⚡ **Energy saving**: Automatically turn off devices in empty rooms
- 👶 **Child monitoring**: Alert if they leave the room during the night
- 🌡️ **Climate control**: Heat/cool only occupied zones

## 📍 Where to Place the Sensor

Optimal sensor placement is crucial for reliable movement detection.

### Recommended Distance from Router

**Optimal range: 3-8 meters**

| Distance | Signal | Multipath | Sensitivity | Noise | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| < 2m | Too strong | Minimal | Low | Low | ❌ Too close |
| 3-8m | Strong | Good | High | Low | ✅ **Optimal** |
| > 10-15m | Weak | Variable | Low | High | ❌ Too far |

### Placement Tips

✅ **Position sensor in the area to monitor** (not necessarily in direct line with router)  
✅ **Height: 1-1.5 meters** from ground (desk/table height)  
✅ **External antenna**: Use IPEX connector for better reception  
❌ **Avoid metal obstacles** between router and sensor (refrigerators, metal cabinets)  
❌ **Avoid corners** or enclosed spaces (reduces multipath diversity)

## ❓ FAQ for Beginners

<details>
<summary>Click to expand FAQ</summary>

**Q: Do I need programming knowledge to use it?**  
A: Basic command line skills are needed to build and flash the firmware using ESP-IDF. Follow the step-by-step guide in SETUP.md.

**Q: Does it work with my router?**  
A: Yes, if your router has 2.4GHz Wi-Fi (virtually all modern routers have it).

**Q: How much does it cost in total?**  
A: Hardware: ~€10 for the ESP32-S3 device. Software: All free and open source. You'll also need a device to run the MQTT broker (Home Assistant or Mosquitto), which can be a Raspberry Pi (~€35-50) or any existing PC/NAS you already have (free).

**Q: Do I need to modify anything on the router?**  
A: No! The router works normally. The sensor "listens" to Wi-Fi signals without modifying anything.

**Q: Can I try it without Home Assistant?**  
A: Yes, you can use any MQTT server (e.g., Mosquitto) or even just view data via serial port.

**Q: Does it work through walls?**  
A: Yes, the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi signal penetrates drywall. Reinforced concrete walls reduce sensitivity but detection remains possible at reduced distances.

**Q: How many sensors are needed for a house?**  
A: It depends on size. One sensor can monitor ~50 m². For larger homes, use multiple sensors (1 sensor every 50-70 m² for optimal coverage).

**Q: Can it distinguish between people and pets?**  
A: The system uses a 2-state segmentation model (IDLE/MOTION) that identifies generic movement without distinguishing between people, pets, or other moving objects. For more sophisticated classification (people vs pets, activity recognition, gesture detection), trained AI/ML models would be required (see Future Evolutions section).

**Q: Does it consume a lot of Wi-Fi bandwidth?**  
A: No, MQTT traffic is minimal. With smart publishing disabled (default), the system publishes all detection updates. When smart publishing is enabled, the system only sends data on significant changes or every 5 seconds as a heartbeat, resulting in ~0.2-0.5 KB/s per sensor during idle periods and up to ~1 KB/s during active movement. Network impact is negligible.

**Q: Does it work with mesh Wi-Fi networks?**  
A: Yes, it works normally. Make sure the ESP32 connects to the 2.4 GHz band.

**Q: Is a dedicated server necessary?**  
A: No, Home Assistant can run on Raspberry Pi, NAS, or cloud. Alternatively, just an MQTT broker (Mosquitto) on any device is sufficient.

**Q: How accurate is the detection?**  
A: Detection accuracy is highly environment-dependent and requires proper tuning. Factors affecting performance include: room layout, wall materials, furniture placement, distance from router (optimal: 3-8m), and interference levels. In optimal conditions with proper tuning, the system provides reliable movement detection. Adjust the `segmentation_threshold` parameter to tune sensitivity for your specific environment.

**Q: What's the power consumption?**  
A: ~500mW typical during continuous operation. The firmware includes support for power optimization, and deep sleep modes can be implemented for battery-powered deployments, though this would require custom modifications to the code.

**Q: If it doesn't work, can I get help?**  
A: Yes, open an [Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/francescopace/espectre/issues) or contact me via email.

![Segmentation Analysis](images/segmentation_analysis.png)
*Moving Variance Segmentation (MVS) analysis: baseline graphs (top) show quiet state, while bottom graphs show motion detection with turbulence signal, adaptive threshold, and state transitions*

<details>
<summary>🔬 Signal Processing Pipeline (click to expand)</summary>

### Data Flow

#### 1️⃣ **CSI Acquisition** (ESP32-S3)
- **Native ESP32 CSI API** captures Wi-Fi Channel State Information via callback
- Extracts amplitude and phase data from OFDM subcarriers (up to 64 subcarriers)
- Typical capture rate: ~10-100 packets/second depending on Wi-Fi traffic

#### 2️⃣ **Motion Segmentation** (ESP32-S3)
- **Spatial turbulence calculation**: Standard deviation of subcarrier amplitudes (raw CSI data)
- **Moving Variance Segmentation (MVS)**: Real-time motion segment extraction
- **Adaptive threshold**: Based on moving variance of turbulence signal
- **Segment features**: Duration, average turbulence, maximum turbulence
- **Circular buffer**: Maintains up to 10 recent segments for analysis
- **Foundation for ML**: Segments can be labeled and used for activity classification

**Note**: Segmentation operates on **raw, unfiltered CSI data** to preserve motion sensitivity. Filters are not applied to the turbulence signal used for segmentation.

#### 3️⃣ **Optional Signal Processing Filters** (ESP32-S3)
Advanced filters applied to CSI data **before feature extraction** (configurable via MQTT):
- **Butterworth Low-Pass**: Removes high-frequency noise >8Hz (environmental interference) - Enabled by default
- **Wavelet db4**: Removes low-frequency persistent noise using Daubechies wavelet transform
- **Hampel Filter**: Outlier removal using MAD (Median Absolute Deviation)
- **Savitzky-Golay Filter**: Polynomial smoothing (enabled by default)

**Filter Pipeline**: Raw CSI → Butterworth (high freq) → Wavelet (low freq) → Hampel → Savitzky-Golay → Features

**Note**: Filters are applied **only to feature extraction**, not to segmentation. Segmentation uses raw CSI data to preserve motion sensitivity.

#### 4️⃣ **Optional Feature Extraction** (ESP32-S3)
When enabled (default: on), extracts 10 mathematical features from **filtered CSI data** during MOTION state:
- **Statistical** (5): Variance, Skewness, Kurtosis, Entropy, IQR
- **Spatial** (3): Spatial variance, correlation, gradient across subcarriers
- **Temporal** (2): Delta mean, delta variance (changes between consecutive packets)

**Note**: Feature extraction can be disabled to reduce CPU usage if only basic motion detection is needed.

#### 5️⃣ **MQTT Publishing** (ESP32-S3 → Broker)
- Publishes JSON payload every 1 second (configurable)
- QoS level 0 (fire-and-forget) for low latency
- Retained message option for last known state
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss

#### 6️⃣ **Home Assistant Integration**
- **MQTT Sensor** subscribes to topic and creates entity
- **State**: Primary `movement` value (0.0-1.0)
- **Attributes**: All other metrics available for conditions
- **History**: Automatic logging to database for graphs

</details>

<details>
<summary>📊 Optional Feature Extraction (click to expand)</summary>

ESPectre can optionally extract **10 mathematical features** from CSI data during MOTION state:

### Extracted Features

#### **Statistical (5 features)**
Statistical properties of the CSI signal distribution:

1. **Variance** - Signal variability, increases significantly with movement
2. **Skewness** - Distribution asymmetry, detects irregular movement patterns
3. **Kurtosis** - Distribution "tailedness", identifies outliers and sudden changes
4. **Entropy** - Signal randomness/disorder, increases when environment changes
5. **IQR** (Interquartile Range) - Robust spread measure (Q3-Q1), resistant to outliers

#### **Spatial (3 features)**
Characteristics across OFDM subcarriers (frequency domain):

6. **Spatial Variance** - Variability across subcarriers, indicates multipath diversity
7. **Spatial Correlation** - Correlation between adjacent subcarriers, affected by movement
8. **Spatial Gradient** - Rate of change across subcarriers, highly sensitive to movement

#### **Temporal (2 features)**
Changes between consecutive CSI packets:

9. **Temporal Delta Mean** - Average absolute difference from previous packet
10. **Temporal Delta Variance** - Variance of differences from previous packet

### Usage

Feature extraction is **enabled by default** but can be disabled to reduce CPU usage.
**Note**: Features are only extracted during MOTION state, not during IDLE, to optimize performance.
